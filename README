Gauntletpy is input mapping program, the overarching goal of this project is to

    "Interface with input devices and output events through output devices"

Obvioulsy inspired by GlovePie! (props! great program) Gauntletpy is to be
"GlovePie for Linux", more modular

Input interfaces:
	Supported:
		Linux Event system (/dev/input/event*)

	Working on it:
		wiimote* (in progress)
		ps3 (stalled, borrowed controller, someone want to buy me one?)
		
	Not gonna doit:
		NONE - I will include or write code to support any device you have, as
		long as I can test it or have a few trusted developers to test and verify
		for me, priority to controllers I have "in hand" .. pun intended :P

Output interfaces are
	Supported:
		Linux Event system (uinput)

Currently
	works to remap inputs from any linux event device to and emulated output device
	examples:
		joysticks to keyboards
		joysticks to mice 
		mice to keyboards (why not?)
		power buttons to joysticks (meh?)
		joysticks to absolute devices (like touch pads)
		midi to keyboards
		(etc, use your imagination)
		

Future plans
	Socket (named, tcp, udp) based input and output
	
	Modularity - event watching could be a boot time daemon,
		emitters would daemons watching named pipes running under another user.
		this has security implications, like reading raw keyboard input - but if
		understood, it might not be important (single user media player for instance)
	
	
Issues:
	64bit/32bit compatibility issues due to some kernel structs being different
	I THINK i have them figured out, right now only one place has an issue - but
	I don't actually have a 32bit system to test on, besides VirtualBox 
	(and time has not permitted me to really test it)
	
	(yeah you read that right, it works fine on 64bit and maybe buggy on 32bit,
	does that seem backward to you too?)
